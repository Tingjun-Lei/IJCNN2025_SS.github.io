    <h2 id="Objectives">Objectives of Special Session</h2>
    <p>
        The aim of this special session is to bring together research that advances the integration of biologically inspired neural networks and learning systems for robotics and mechatronics. Biologically inspired neural models, such as neural dynamics, have shown promising applications in solving complex problems in robotics, including motion planning, localization, navigation, and mapping.
    </p>
    <p>
        Biologically inspired intelligence represents a crucial and expanding field within computational intelligence, significantly advancing robotics and autonomous systems. The rapid growth in the autonomous robot and mechatronics industries has profoundly impacted both the economy and society, a trend poised to accelerate with the integration of biologically inspired intelligence techniques. These approaches, such as biologically inspired neural networks and learning systems (BNNLS), leverage insights from nature to solve complex challenges in real-world robotics, and mechatronics and autonomous systems. By mimicking natural processes and neural architecture, these models enhance robotic functionality and adaptability in dynamic environments. In mechatronic systems, bio-inspired neural networks and learning systems play a critical role in optimizing sensor configuration, improving robot design, advancing motion control, and enabling autonomous system capabilities. Recent advancements in bio-inspired systems for robotics and mechatronics have spurred international research efforts focused on creating adaptive, efficient, and intelligent systems. Key areas include biologically inspired neural network algorithms, brain-inspired neural networks, and emerging deep learning models like deep reinforcement learning, which facilitate complex decision-making and autonomous adaptation. Additionally, swarm intelligence techniques such as swarm intelligence-based neural networks, socially guided neural learning, when fused with BNNLS, yield innovative solutions for cooperative tasks, navigation, and dynamic problem-solving in robotics.
    </p>
    <p>
This session seeks papers that contribute novel models and methodologies for applying bio-inspired neural approaches to robotics and mechatronics, focusing on both theoretical advancements and practical applications. The goal is to highlight the interdisciplinary potential of these approaches in creating efficient, adaptable, and robust systems, fostering discussions on current challenges, emerging trends, and future directions in this field. This special session highlights and promotes the growing interest in emerging research, development, and applications within the dynamic fields of biologically inspired neural networks and learning systems. The session will focus on innovative algorithms and approaches for enhancing robotics, mechatronics, and autonomous systems (such as autonomous robots, unmanned underwater vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles), and mechatronics.
    </p>
    <p>
Further integration of BNNLS with biologically inspired evolutionary algorithms enables advancements across essential applications, including machine vision, pattern recognition, motion control, and sensor-motor coordination. These developments extend to crucial functions such as autonomous motion planning, movement control, and learning in adaptive, time-sensitive environments. As biologically inspired intelligence and learning systems continue to evolve, they promise to enhance the sophistication and functionality of robotic, mechatronics, and vehicle systems, shaping the future of autonomous technologies.
